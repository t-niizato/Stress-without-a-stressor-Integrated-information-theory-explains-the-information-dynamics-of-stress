## Computing IIT values from raw data

We listed sample raw data for IIT computation in MATLAB 2020b.

Before running our program, please import the practical PHI toolbox (https://figshare.com/articles/code/phi_toolbox_zip/3203326).

Run Main_Complex_Computation (MIP_computation).

## The analysis in our paper

We listed all used IIT computation datasets and the subjective scores in Figure_results file.

Run .mxf files and you'll get some figures we used in the paper.

Please reread some words (Active, Control, Passive condition) to the new words (Moderate, Easy, Difficult condition).
